						<h5 class="proj-date">October 14 - 21, 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>:  Design, build, and test a small-scale prototype of a lifting mechanism to lift at least 100 grams of weight 30 centimeters.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">In this project, we were asked to work together in teams of 4 to design and build a mechanical winch system using VEX or Fischertech parts that could lift at least 100 grams at least 30 centimeters over the 
						side of a table, and was controlled by a switch. Additionally, we were required to create a NetLogo program to simulate our system, demonstrating the effect of drum size, voltage, and weight on the linear speed. Finally, we needed to take measurements while our system was running (force, distance, time, voltage, current) 
						with the help of a multimeter, to calculate the work, input/output power, and efficiency of the mechanism.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">My role as project manager was to ensure that all tasks were being completed on time, and that my fellow group members were all contributing 
						to the project work in a timely and productive manner. I wrote much of the project documentation and NetLogo simulation code, and oversaw the building of the prototype as it was being constructed by two of my other group members. Through this project, I learned more about the 
						practical applications of the formulas we had learned previously in class, as well as how to stick to a strict schedule when completing a complex and time-consuming prototype. Although we did face plenty of challenges when constructing the prototype (especially with our sprocket-and-chain system), we 
						managed to finish on time, and it was an enjoyable experience.</p>

    					<h3 class="proj-header">Solar Hydrogen Vehicle, POE</h3>
						<h5 class="proj-date">November 3 - 17, 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>:  Design and construct a vehicle that will run using solar and/or hydrogen power, to gather information about different energy source combinations and formulate a recommendation for power generation.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">This project required us to work in teams of 4 to design a solar hydrogen vehicle that could easily switch between power sources. After constructing our prototype, we were instructed to measure the voltage, current, force, and run time of the vehicle. We used the data from the test runs to 
						calculate the vehicle's electrical power, mechanical power, speed, and efficiency for each of the 4 energy source configurations (1 solar cell, 1 hydrogen cell, 2 solar cells wired in series, and 2 hydrogen cells in parallel), and then determined which combination was most efficient for a full-scale vehicle.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">In our final solution, the fuel cell directly connects to a motor through a breadboard, which in turn directly powers an axle that is connected to a sprocket system. When the fuel cell generates enough energy, the sprocket system turns the front and back wheels, allowing the vehicle to move. 
						After thoroughly evaluating each power source configuration, we came to the conclusion that using two solar cells would the most efficient power source for such a vehicle, since it had the highest calculated efficiency. </p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">This project allowed me to apply the power and electricity concepts from class to the task of building a vehicle that was powered by a renewable energy source. My role was to design, test, and evaluate the prototype, as well as contribute to the project documentation. </p>

    					<h3 class="proj-header">Aerodynamic Design, POE</h3>
						<h5 class="proj-date">January 10 - February 2, 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>:  Design and construct a rocket that provides the greatest horizontal displacement.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">This project required us to work in teams of 3 to test our individually built paper rockets. My initial prototype consisted of a slender cylindrical body, a concealed pressure cap, and  a large nose cone, all constructed with paper and secured with both masking and duct tape. To construct the pressure cap, I cut out a small square of paper
						and then firmly taped it over the opening of the rocket body, layering it with duct tape. </p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">I made the nose cone slightly longer and narrower, to optimize thrust. I added more layers of duct tape to secure my rocket's pressure cap, and laminated the entire rocket with clear tape. I added three paper wings towards the base of the rocket, to minimize drag and allow it to travel through the air freely. 
						When I launched my rocket at a 45 degree angle, it was in the air for only 5.95 seconds and travelled 114 yards (342 feet). I later calculated the initial velocity to be 110.64 ft/s, which allowed me to apply concepts and formulas from class.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">My role was to launch the rockets for myself and my team, and help contribute to the project documentation. </p>
