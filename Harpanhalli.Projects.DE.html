						<h5 class="proj-date">October 9 - 26, 2018</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>:  
						Design and create a printed circuit board (PCB) for a circuit 
						of your choice.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">For this project, I worked independently 
						to create a light activated sensor with a 555 timer 
						integrated circuit. When an external light source 
						(such as a flashlight or a lamp) is shined on the 
						light-dependent resistor (LDR), the light-emitting diode 
						(LED) lights up. As soon as the light does not fall on the 
						LDR, the LED no longer lights up. The circuit was first 
						wired on a breadboard for testing purposes. A layout for 
						the printed circuit board (PCB) was created using the program 
						Fritzing. The PCB layout was then printed onto glossy paper 
						and masked onto the copper PCB. A permanent marker was used 
						to fill in portions of the PCB where the mask was unclear or 
						broken. After being masked, the copper board was etched 
						using ferric chloride solution. After drilling holes in 
						the board and soldering on the components, the final 
						solution was complete.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"> My final circuit PCB had only 
						some of the desired functionality. I attempted to 
						troubleshoot the circuit by checking all of the connections 
						with a multimeter, and replacing and re-soldering components. 
						When the batteries are placed in the battery holder, the 
						LED instantly glowed. Although the LDR was detecting the 
						changes in light, the circuit did not respond to any of 
						these changes.</p> 
						<p class="proj-paragraph"> Although I was unsuccessful in 
						reaching my final goal, this project was a valuable learning 
						experience for me. It was my first exposure to PCB design 
						techniques and electronics concepts that were completely 
						unfamiliar to me before. I also gained firsthand experience 
						with the painstaking process of troubleshooting an 
						electronic circuit.</p>

    					<h5 class="proj-date">January 15 - 31, 2019</h5>
    					<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>:  
						Work as a team to display a message on a group of 
						seven segment displays to simulate a LED display board.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">In this project, I worked with 
						three other team members to design, build, and test a 
						circuit which displays a scrolling LED message. This 
						message, "join DE", encourages high school students to 
						join PLTW's Digital Electronics (DE) class and could be 
						displayed at a school open house night. I was responsible 
						for creating two of the eight seven-segment displays 
						(SSDs) used in the circuit, as well as coordinating the 
						group's daily tasks on an organized Gantt Chart. During 
						the project timeline, I created truth tables, wrote logic 
						expressions, electronically simulated, and breadboarded 
						the two SSDs. Additionally, I calculated the efficiency 
						of IC usage in the final group circuit, and contributed 
						to the project documentation linked below.</p>
