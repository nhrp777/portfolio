						<h5 class="proj-date">September 2015</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: To develop a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76802582/">game</a> with user interaction that significantly alters events, as well as a clear objective with multiple stages.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">My partner and I documented our work through Scratch comments and a detailed Project Design Logbook with our initial brainstorm and early drafts and versions of the game. This project introduced me to the engineering design process. The drag-and-drop format of MIT's <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> programming language eased me into the world of algorithms and practical applications. 
						We encountered challenges with transitional elements and sprite movement, but we persevered through our difficulties. I took up a central role devising alternative solutions and utilized many online resources to guide me through the process. Our decisions were made unanimously, with each of us providing input on level design and graphics.</p>

						<h5 class="proj-date">October - November 2015</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: To create an online engineering portfolio using HTML and CSS and upload it to the Internet.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">After completing a series of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> tutorials, we were asked to apply the basic HTML skills we learned to create an online portfolio showcasing all of our projects and work experience during our time at Dublin High School. I used Notepad++ to develop each of this site's pages and Bootstrap for simplified codebits. After fulfilling the basic guidelines, I began expanding on them by embedding my documents, linking to external sources, and adding in features unique to each page.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"> I encountered challenges with displaying an image and text side by side, utilizing online resources including <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3C Schools</a>. When asked to provide technical and creative input to others, I always obliged and was more than happy to share my solutions to problems that I had also experienced.</p>

						<h5 class="proj-date">December 2015 - January 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: To develop and modify an Android application using <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/index-2.html">MIT App Inventor 2</a>.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">We were asked to choose the idea and function of our application from a large selection of App Inventor 2 tutorials. My partner and I chose to develop a PhotoBooth application that would allow the user to take a picture, assign the image to a canvas, and share the image via email.</p> 
						<p class="proj-paragraph">After building the template with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1trt9smFfyiztdVoaq5ONaOM8GWOMoSFxTRJ7Eyyajuw/pub">this tutorial</a>, we embarked on modifying the application's capabilities. Some of our changes included in-app notifications, an Image Picker, and a Paint feature which would allow users to digitally edit their images within the app.</p>					<p class="proj-paragraph">We documented our design process by updating a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13N-hS-i1m9cRX1PLRN1CnJ0VHGehe39z6uBYbuIaork/edit">Project Design Logbook</a>. This included our initial brainstorm, plans for modifications, and problems we encountered. In this project, I learned to adapt and familiarize myself with a different coding environment. I also prepared myself for Python through my mastery of more advanced concepts, including: introducing global and local variables, storing information in a database, and connecting various components to build a functioning app.</p>

    					<h3 class="proj-header">Python Text Adventure, CSE</h3>
						<h5 class="proj-date">February - March 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: To create a Text Adventure that incorporates multiple functions and user interaction between storyline branch points.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">In building our Text Adventure, we were asked to apply our knowledge of Python from the introductory courses in Codecademy, especially conditionals and functions. We used <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Enthought Canopy's</a> interactive environment to build the Text Adventure, often referencing the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">Python Style Guide</a> for additional resources for coding.</p> 
						<p class="proj-paragraph">We began by diagramming our initial ideas using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1fDFW8c76_0LSu2UdLa_vaV6F2ezzvzbIdnqeNDW713I/edit?usp=sharing">flow-chart</a>: a helpful method of clearly outlining the order in which each act would be printed to the screen.  We then created functions for each branch point in the storyline, and allowed those functions to be called with conditionals based on a user's raw input. 
						With the remaining time, we expanded the conditional statements to account for alternative responses and removed its case-sensitivity.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">My partner and I did maintain a strong team dynamic during the timeline of the project, assigning ourselves an equitable workload, with each of us providing creative ideas and making decisions as to how to implement them.</p>

						<h5 class="proj-date">March 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: Use Python to create a fully functional Hangman Game.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">We were given a timeframe of just one week to complete this project. My partner and I began by defining a function hangman_display, which takes in an input guessed and checks to see if it is contained in the secret word. 
						We then modified this function to include additional capabilities, such as limiting the number of possible attempts and incrementing a variable to measure how many incorrect characters were guessed.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">Also, we came up with a method of allowing the user to select a theme to play with before starting the game. For final touches, we added ASCII art at each stage of the game. We received positive feedback from the class during the Gallery Walk, 
						especially pertaining to our creative decisions and how we constructed our functions.</p>

						<h5 class="proj-date">May 13, 2016 - May 31, 2016</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: In a timeframe of 2 weeks, follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qNk63eptOMDduPyAdnvX7vdywbWRlnDgP4v7oVJo5sk/edit?usp=sharing">project requirements</a> to create a unique and marketable product that benefits a target consumer.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">I worked with Christy Koh to build a mobile application that guides students through the process of creating a long-term plan for their high school education. 
						Students can keep track of their coursework, volunteer hours, and manage their activities (clubs and sports) both in and out of school, as well as measure their progress based 
						on the requirements for their chosen diploma. The app is specifically designed for all students attending <a href="http://www.dublin.k12.ca.us/cms/lib5/CA01001424/Centricity/Domain/18/DHS%20Diploma.pdf">Dublin High School</a>, with the options of selecting a regular Diploma, Diploma with Distinction, 
						or Advanced Scholar Diploma.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">Due to the short timeframe, we have so far built an initial prototype for Android phones using <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">MIT App Inventor</a>. We will continue to develop the application over summer 
						break and create a final product, which we hope to market at school and enter in the City of Dublin Youth Expo Hackathon during <a href="http://dublinca.gov/1145/Splatter">Splatter</a>.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">I designed the order and layout of each of the screens, and worked to construct many of the screens and forms during the development process. 
						I also built the functions that allowed for the modification and deletion of previous entries, and moved on to program the majority of the Volunteering and Activities screens, calling list entries from the local database and then using a ListView component to sort and display them on the dashboard. 
						During the class period, I conducted several thorough test runs of the application, scrutinizing every piece of code and taking note of any bugs or runtime errors encountered, and made sure to communicate with my partner about possible fixes.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">We qualified for the student showcase, placing within the top 5 in both of our classes.</p>
