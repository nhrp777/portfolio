						<h5 class="proj-date">December 8 - 15, 2017</h5>
						<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>:  
						Design, build, and test an Android mobile application 
						using Android Studio.</p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">In this project, we were asked 
						to use Android Studio to develop a mobile application. 
						I worked with 3 other students to develop the OrElse mobile 
						application, which allows a student to store and prioritize 
						upcoming homework assignments for each of their classes. 
						The student will manually input each assignment, giving it a 
						due date and priority multiplier, as well as inputting their 
						current grade in the class. The assignments will then be 
						displayed, and can be organized by priority multiplier, 
						due date, or class grade. 
						This application was designed and developed as a proof of 
						concept -- all information was local to the device. </p>
						<p class="proj-paragraph">In my role, I designed and 
						programmed the application's login screen, and documented 
						the main part of the project. I also worked on designing 
						the prototype in Proto.io, creating the Assignment List, 
						and programming the add and remove assignment functions. 
						This project helped me learn the fundamentals of app 
						development in Android Studio; more specifically, user 
						input, app navigation, and how to write JUnit test classes. 
						We identified a problem in our community and learned how to 
						logically isolate each component to address and solve it.  
						I approached the problem through user-centric design, exploring how 
						the user will interact with each component of our application. </p>

    				<h5 class="proj-date">May 7 - 24, 2018</h5>
    				<p class="proj-paragraph"><strong>Project Objective</strong>: 
    				In a two week timeline, devise a unique and marketable product 
    				which benefits a target consumer and incorporates computer 
    				science concepts and skills.</p>
    				<p class="proj-paragraph">I worked independently to prototype 
    				sporttracker, a mobile application designed to streamline the 
    				timecard hours verification process for high school student 
    				athletes enrolled in athletic PE. Under the current system, 
    				students physically bring their timecards to their coaches 
    				and the athletic director for signatures. Coaches and 
    				athletic directors find it difficult to monitor student 
    				progression and completion of hours. Also, physical timecards 
    				can get damaged or lost, and are not always accessible. </p>
    				<p class="proj-paragraph">I first conducted background research 
    				about current athletic PE timecard systems in place at several 
    				local high schools. I then sketched out a concept for each screen 
    				on a notepad, created user stories, and prototyped the 
    				application using the online platform Fluid UI. Throughout 
    				the design process, I shared my concept with student athletes 
    				and coaches across various sports and recorded their feedback 
    				to make sporttracker as user-friendly as possible.</p>
    				<p class="proj-paragraph">The final solution was designed 
    				with three tiers of users in mind: students, coaches, and 
    				athletic directors. After registering with the app and joining 
    				a sport, students can generate a virtual timecard and update 
    				their hours every week. The coaches and athletic directors 
    				will have a virtual roster of all of the students who 
    				registered with their school and sport, and will be able to 
    				electronically approve each student's hours for the week. </p>
    				<p class="proj-paragraph">This project helped me gain further 
    				insight into the process of developing an app from start to 
    				finish. It also reinforced my knowledge of the engineering 
    				design process. </p>
