					<h3 class="abt-header"> I never imagined the depth of my interest in engineering.</h3>
					<p class="abt-paragraph">I am a passionate and dedicated senior who puts 
					in my best effort in everything I attempt. I seek to pursue a career in 
					computer science, given my strong interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). 
					Since joining the Engineering and Design Academy during my freshman year of high school, 
					I have developed a passion for digital innovation and creative thought. 
					I hope to apply my strong foundation in writing, mathematics, and science to my work as I traverse my career path.</p>
					
					<p class="abt-paragraph">What draws me to engineering 
					is its promotion of hands-on experimentation and critical thinking, while providing real-world challenges and constraints.
					Enrolling in Project Lead the Way's Computer Science and Software Engineering course during my freshman year led me to 
					realize my passion for this engineering discipline. Additionally, I have been working with a fellow student for the past four years
					to develop <a href="http://stayoncourseapp.com">Stay on Course</a>, a mobile application for high school students to track the requirements they have fulfilled while working 
					towards their desired diploma; this long-term project has exposed me to a wide range of programming languages and environments, including 
					Javascript, Angular, and SQL. Last year, I took AP Computer Science A, where I refined my skills in Java programming and mobile app development using Android Studio.
					Currently, I am enrolled in Digital Electronics, where I'm exploring electrical engineering -- a field that is completely new to me. I love the challenge!</p>
					
					<!--<p class="abt-paragraph">Also, writing has always been a passion of mine: an avenue to express my inner creativity. Having 
					achieved some degree of success after self-publishing my novel two years ago, I feel fairly confident in my abilities 
					as a writer. I have received accolades in contests sponsored by Scholastic, the California Writers Club, the Asian Pacific Fund,
					and the Dublin Pride Week Committee. I am also the Student/Campus Life Editor for Dublin High School's student news source, 
					The Dublin Shield, a contributor to award-winning education blog OneDublin.org, and a teen reviewer for the Dublin Library.</p>-->
					
					<p class="abt-paragraph">I consider my desire for knowledge one of my most redeeming qualities. I hope to continue to express 
					my creativity, not only through my writing, but also through my keen interest in science. mathematics, and technology. Please explore
					this site for more information about my skills and some of the projects I have worked on. Thank you for your time.</p>
