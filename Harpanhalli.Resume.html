   		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> As a part of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have 
   	    attended multiple engineering field trips. In October 
   		2016, I enjoyed attending EECS Day at UC Berkeley, hosted by the campus 
   		chapter of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), an electrical engineering and computer science 
   		honor society. I experienced a day in the life of a EECS student at UC Berkeley, 
   		taking a department tour of the facilities and labs and listening to a lecture 
   		by EECS professor John DeNero. I loved meeting current UC Berkeley students, 
   		who guided us on the tour and shared their high school and college experiences. </p>
   		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> 
		In February 2017, I attended the RiskIQ Cybersecurity Converge Tour in 
		San Francisco with 15 other female students. This event included an industry 
		panel and networking lunch, as well as a cybersecurity capture the flag competition, 
		where my partner and I won second place. It really interested me in the growing 
		field of cybersecurity, a field I had never considered working in before. </p>
		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> 
		In March 2018, I visited Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California. I 
		had the opportunity to listen to a group of employees discuss how 
		they worked to develop a Google product, Bulletin, and learned about how
		the engineering design process is applied to develop real-world applications.
		I also toured parts of the Google campus and some of the visitor attractions.</p> 
	    <p class="res-header" style="margin-left: 70px; font-size: 15px">Guest Speakers</p>
		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> During my Principles of Engineering class 
		and my time in the Engineering Academy junior mentorship program, I listened 
		to fascinating talks from industry professionals including Ms. Danielle Demmon 
		and Mr. Anthony Strawa. An electrical engineer at Lockheed Martin, Ms. Demmon 
		vividly described electrical engineering and its many applications in her presentation. 
		It was particularly interesting to hear how electrical engineering is connected to 
		computer science and biomedical engineering, two fields I am interested in 
		pursuing in college. Mr. Strawa, the director of the New Opportunities office 
		at the NASA Ames Research Center, discussed innovative technologies and 
		interdisciplinary scientific discoveries.  I learned a lot about aerospace 
		engineering from Mr. Strawa's presentation, which also included some 
		interesting details about past NASA projects concerned with 
		extraterrestrial life.  </p>
		<p class="res-header" style="margin-left: 70px; font-size: 15px">Junior Year Mentorship Program</p>
		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px">During the 2017-2018 school year, I had the unique 
		opportunity of participating in a one-year mentorship program within 
		the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy. My mentor, 
		Ms. Erin Chia, has a PhD in biomedical engineering and works at 
		Bio-Rad Laboratories. Although we had different fields 
		of interest, I enjoyed discussing my academic progress and achievements
		with her. We spent time exploring different colleges and careers, and 
		working on resume building and goal setting. I also had the 
		chance to network with other program mentors, and thus learned about 
		different engineering disciplines. This program was a very meaningful 
		experience and I definitely valued being a part of it. </p>
