   		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> As a part of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have 
   	    attended multiple engineering field trips. In October 
   		2016, I enjoyed attending EECS Day at UC Berkeley, hosted by the campus 
   		chapter of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), an electrical engineering and computer science 
   		honor society. I experienced a day in the life of a EECS student at UC Berkeley, 
   		taking a department tour of the facilities and labs and listening to a lecture 
   		by EECS professor John DeNero. I loved meeting current UC Berkeley students, 
   		who guided us on the tour and shared their high school and college experiences. 
		In February 2017, I attended the RiskIQ Cybersecurity Converge Tour in 
		San Francisco with 15 other female students. This event included an industry 
		panel and networking lunch, as well as a cybersecurity capture the flag competition, 
		where my partner and I won second place. It really interested me in the growing 
		field of cybersecurity, a field I had never considered working in before. 
		This year, I visited Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California. I 
		had the opportunity to listen to a group of employees discuss how 
		they worked to develop a Google product, Bulletin, and learned about how
		the engineering design process is applied to develop real-world applications.
		I also toured parts of the Google campus and some of the visitor attractions.</p> 
		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> During my Principles of Engineering class and my time in the Engineering Academy 
		junior mentorship program, I heard talks by guest speakers including Ms. Danielle 
		Demmon from Lockheed Martin and Ms. Erin Chia from Bio-Rad Laboratories. In her 
		presentation, Ms. Demmon described electrical engineering and its many 
		applications; it was particularly interesting to hear how it connected to 
		computer science and biomedical technologies, two fields I am interested 
		in pursuing. Ms. Chia spoke about her background in biomedical and chemical 
		engineering, and her work with polymers, which fascinated me due to my 
		growing passion for biology and chemistry. </p>
		<p id="res-text" style="margin-left: 70px"> This year, I had the unique opportunity
		of participating in a one-year mentorship program within the Dublin High School Engineering 
		and Design Academy. My mentor, Ms. Erin Chia, has a PhD in biomedical engineering 
		and works at Bio-Rad Laboratories. Although we have slightly different fields 
		of interest, I enjoyed discussing my academic progress with her. We 
		also spent time with college and career exploration, resume building,
		and goal setting. This program was a very meaningful experience and I 
		definitely learned a lot through my exposure to different engineering
		disciplines.</p>
